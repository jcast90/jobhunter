## Simple application for job hunting
Using the remotive API and remote OK API we source job remote job postings and display them in a fun way!

## TODO:
- add logic for search field to convert tags to "buttons" so a user can remove the tag if they want
- work on search query so it can be more dynamic
- add in filter options (ie. filter by country, by salary, by posting type)
- implement a world view map that allows users to see where the jobs are located at a glance
- clean up UI, create a dashboard that shows a list of jobs, the map view, and potentially salary rankings if applicable
- add in loader animation
- show options for categories (ie. designer, developer, product manager, etc.)
